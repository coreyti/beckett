# WIP::Checklist

A CLI and console application for managing Github-backed checklists.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wip-checklist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wip-checklist

## Usage

`wip-checklist help`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec wip-checklist` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
